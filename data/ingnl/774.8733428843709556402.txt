### No access to My ING?

You can easily close your ING Current Account via the Mobile App or My ING. If there is less then € 250,- on your account (including the balance on the connected Savings Account), you can close your Current Account via phone.
For a balance until € 1.000,- you can also visit a ING Servicepoint. Don't forget to bring a valid ID during your visit. Check the location finder for the nearest ING Servicepoint.
It is not possible to close your account by sending us a letter. We will not be able to process these kind of requests.

## Balance on your account

The required minimum balance on the current account is €0,-. We will transfer the positive balance to the account you specified. If you would like to transfer your balance to an account outside the SEPA area, you can arrange this via My ING. Please note that this involves certain costs.

## Products linked to your current account

Closing your account means that some products linked to that account will be terminated as well. Think of your savings account, debit card and overdraft facility. Unfortunately, your ING Points will expire too.Some other products need to be terminated or transferred by you in person, such as your credit card and your savings deposit. Not sure which products are linked? During the process of closing your current account, you will get information about linked products and how to deal with them. Do you have a Mortgage or Insurance linked to your account? Please call our customer service.
