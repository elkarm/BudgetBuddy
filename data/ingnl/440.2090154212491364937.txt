# Student statement - Hey student,

Tell us you are studying Are you registered with an accredited educational institution for MBO, HBO or WO in the Netherland and do you have a Student Account? Then you can indicate here that you are studying by means of a statement from the age of 19.
Without a statement or DUO income, your Student Account will be converted to a Current Account. The account will no longer be free of charge. Costs can be found here

## Do you want to (continue to) use the Student Account?

Let us know that you are studying. You can do this by linking your Duo-loan to your student account or declare once a year that you are studying.
We may also ask you to show a valid proof of registration from your educational institution, for example If it turns out that you do not receive any monthly payment from DUO.
Tell us you are studying!

## No longer a student?

### If you are not a student (anymore) you do not have to do anything. Nice, right?
