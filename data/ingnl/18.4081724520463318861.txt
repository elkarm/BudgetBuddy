### Changing a Student Account to a Current Account

During your studies you can use an ING Student Account. Are you done studying? Then your Student Account will automatically be converted into a Current Account as part of an OranjePakket.

### Your account number, card and internet banking remain the same

You keep your own account number, debit card and PIN, and you can continue using internet banking and your Mobile Banking App.

### What else changes when changing?

Your Student Credit card is converted into a Credit card with the same spending limit. Because a Credit card is not part of an OranjePakket, you pay for it separately, just as you did before. You can keep on using your current credit card. If you have a Student payment limit, it will be converted into a "Continu limiet" for former students. Your limit will stay the same. If your income drops, it may be wise to lower or end your limit.

### Tip: Mind your Student Insurance

If you are no longer studying, the student policies you have with your insurer are no longer valid. So adjust your insurance policies in time to make sure you are properly insured. Consider, for example, your home contents insurance, your liability insurance or your health insurance.
