## Switching from another Dutch bank?

In case you already have a Dutch current account at another bank and wish to move your banking matters to ING, then you can make use of our handy switching service:
* We will redirect your debits and credits to your new account for 13 months
* If you pay your bills by direct debit, your new account number will automatically be sent to these companies
* You can see which debits and credits still run through your old account and which ones your previous bank has stopped in the Mobile Banking App and My ING
* You set the date when the switching service starts
